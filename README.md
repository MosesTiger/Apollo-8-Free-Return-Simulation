# Apollo 8 Free Return Simulation

## Overview
This Python project simulates the free return trajectory of the Apollo 8 mission using Turtle Graphics. It models the gravitational interactions between Earth, Moon, and the Apollo spacecraft, providing a visual representation of this historical space mission.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of Apollo 8's free return trajectory.
- Interactive graphical representation of Earth, Moon, and the spacecraft.
- Physics-based movement accounting for gravitational forces between celestial bodies.
- Custom Turtle shapes representing Earth, Moon, and the spacecraft.
